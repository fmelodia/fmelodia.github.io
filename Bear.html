<br>
<h2>Advanced Search</h2>
<p>Bear can instantly search all your notes, but it also has a number of <b>search triggers</b> that can zero in on certain <b>types</b> of things in your notes.</p>
<br>
<p>For example, you can add tasks to notes to help you plan what still needs to be done with them. On iOS, swipe the shortcut bar above the keyboard to the left, and tap the task button (a square with a checkmark). On a Mac, use Format <span class='arrow'><svg width="11px" height="10px" viewBox="0 0 11 10" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" >    <g id="right-arrow" >        <path d="M1.77635684e-14,5 L9,5" id="rod" stroke="#000000" stroke-width="2" ></path>        <path d="M11,5 L6,0.5 L6,9.5 L11,5 Z" id="point" fill="#000000"></path>    </g></svg></span> Todo <span class='arrow'><svg width="11px" height="10px" viewBox="0 0 11 10" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" >    <g id="right-arrow" >        <path d="M1.77635684e-14,5 L9,5" id="rod" stroke="#000000" stroke-width="2" ></path>        <path d="M11,5 L6,0.5 L6,9.5 L11,5 Z" id="point" fill="#000000"></path>    </g></svg></span> Toggle.</p>
<br>
<p>Now, in Bear’s search box, you can type <code class='code-inline'>@todo</code> or <code class='code-inline'>@task</code> in to find all your notes that still have tasks to finish. For bonus points, you can also search <code class='code-inline'>@done</code> to find all notes with tasks that you’ve already completed.</p>
<br>
<p>Bear’s search triggers are: <code class='code-inline'>@todo, @task, @done, @code @tagged, @untagged, @files, @images, @attachments</code>. </p>
<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/182400202">Check out this video</a> to see Bear’s search features in action.</p>
<br>
<p>Finally, you can use double quotes to search specific phrases, such as <code class='code-inline'>"bear is cool"</code></p>
<br>
<h2>Tips 🎩</h2>
<p>All tags in Bear are tappable and clickable. To give it a try, hide the keyboard and tap <span class='hashtag'>#welcome/pro</span> — the Notes List will appear and show you all notes that contain it.</p>
<br>
<p>On Mac, you can hide the Sidebar and/or Notes List to enjoy distraction-free writing (on iOS, this happens automatically 😉). Use the <b>layout selector</b> (the bottom right icon) to see your options.</p>
<br>
